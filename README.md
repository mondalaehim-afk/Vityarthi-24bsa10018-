Project Title: Personal Task Manager
1. Problem Identification
Context:
Students and professionals often struggle to keep track of their daily tasks, deadlines, and priorities. Without a simple system, important responsibilities can be forgotten or delayed.
Problem Statement:
How can we provide a simple, easy-to-use application that helps users manage their tasks, ensuring improved productivity and organization?
2. Technical Solution Design
Objective:
Develop a Java-based console application where users can add, view, update, and remove personal tasks, with features for deadlines and priority levels.
Core Features:

* Add Task: Users can add tasks with a description, due date, and priority (Low, Medium, High).
* View Tasks: List all tasks, optionally sorted by deadline or priority.
* Update Task: Modify the description, due date, or priority of a task.
* Remove Task: Delete a task from the list.
* Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as done.
* Save/Load: Persist tasks to a file so tasks are saved across program runs.

Data Model:

* Task object:

id (unique identifier)
description
dueDate
priority
isCompleted
4. Documentation Outline

* 
README.md

Project description, features, and use cases.
Instructions for compiling and running.
Brief info on code structure.


* 
In-code comments

Document method functionality, parameters, and logic.


* 
Evaluation

Discuss how the system solves the problem.
Mention possible extensions (e.g., GUI, notifications).




5. Demonstration Plan

* Prepare a sample user session (adding, viewing, and completing tasks).
* Show how data persists between sessions by saving and reloading.


Project Summary
This project addresses the common problem of task management using core Java concepts:

* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects)
* File I/O (serialization/deserialization)
* Collections (ArrayList)
* User interaction (Scanner, console menus)
